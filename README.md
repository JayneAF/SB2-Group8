## Tools Used

Below are are list of tools used, and the precise things they were used for:

- [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) for dark theme switcher icons
- [Icon8](https://icons8.com/) for scroll-tot-top icon
- [Roboto font](https://icons8.com/) for font family
- [Favicon IO](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) for favicons.

## Folder Structure

The index.html, app.js, style.css, screenshot and readme files are in the root folder.

The img folder contains all images and icons used, in their respective folders.

## Customization Guide

The various sections in the HTML and CSS are well commented, so feel free to change whatever doesn't suit your need.

The JavaScript functions are commented too, so you will know what the functions and selections do.

I used Ion Icons and Icons8 for the icons, but feel free to use fontawesome or any other icon library you want.
